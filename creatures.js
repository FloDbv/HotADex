Suffers no penalty for attacking in melee or over obstacles. Casts a random mass buff or debuff spell at the Expert level every three rounds." }, "lore": "Specially trained by the dragon slayer Dracon, Enchanters are an elite fighting force recruited from the ranks of Monks, Zealots, Magi, and Arch Magi.", "gameplay_analysis": "The Enchanter's health and defense values are the lowest for a level 6 troop. The tactic for using them is very simple: keep them alive so they can cast their mass spells. Keep in mind their low health makes them very vulnerable to any kind of damage." },

Casts a random offensive spell instead of a regular attack. Has a built-in Basic Magic Mirror, giving it a chance to reflect enemy spells." }, "lore": "Faerie Dragons are deceptively cute, but in truth, are mischievous tricksters. What is known is found more in storybooks than magical tomes.", "gameplay_analysis": "The strategy of a Faerie Dragon is very simple: strike where it hurts the most from afar, dealing full damage with spells. Their main attack is casting a random offensive spell, with the spell's power being five times the number of Faerie Dragons in the stack. If you use the 'wait' command, their spell will be rerolled when their turn comes again." },

With this appetite, Rust Dragons spew a concentrated acid as their primary attack.", "gameplay_analysis": "With their incredibly high speed, health, and attack damage, Rust Dragons are generally considered the third strongest creatures in the game, following only Azure Dragons and Crystal Dragons. Their Acid Breath ability is very strategic, as it permanently reduces the target's defense for the rest of the battle, and the effect is cumulative." },

It is both rare and mighty, thus few have seen it, and fewer still have survived its attacks. It is said those standing face-to-face with an Azure Dragon tend to freeze from pure fear.", "gameplay_analysis": "The Azure Dragon has the highest attack, defense, damage, and health values of all creatures, making it arguably the strongest unit in the game. It is also the most expensive unit. The Fear ability can turn the tide of a battle by causing enemy stacks to lose their turns." }

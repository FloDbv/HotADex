If playing on impossible difficulty it may be a while before you can utilize the specialty since the Mage Tower is considerably expensive early game unless you find an external dwelling.</p><p>The specialty results in Arch Magi having speed 8, tying with the Cyclops King and Storm Elemental. This is fast for a ranged unit (only Sharpshooters, Enchanters, and Titans are faster) which allows Arch Magi to act before many strong enemy troops such as Basilisks and Pit Lords. Theodorus doesn't start with Sorcery or Scholar allowing him to learn other skills that may be more desirable (note that as a Wizard he does still have a high chance to learn those skills). Ballistics has some synergy with Tower troops as due to their low speed (fastest troops are Master Genies and Titans with speed 11) you may not get the first cast in a battle. During a siege however, as long as there isn't a defending hero with Artillery you will get the first move thanks to the catapult enabling you to buff your army or cripple the enemy troops.</p>"

Somewhat unfortunately though, basilisks are 2 hex creatures which can be a nuisance to themselves and the rest of the army if they are split. Still, this is a very useful early game tactic.
